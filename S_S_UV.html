							<h1>Spirals from Space in Ultra-Violet</h1>
							
                            <p><b>Well done, your proposal was accepted!</b>
                            
                            <p>We can learn a lot about spiral galaxies by observing them in ultra-violet wavelengths. Since ultra-violet light cant penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, choosing to observe from space was the right decision! We can't wait to see what you discover.
                            
                            <p> You may have been inspired by a study published in January 2021, looking at the spiral galaxy NGC 7793. Scientists used the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) located onboard the ASTROSAT satallite to image the galaxy. They used the telescope to look at the regions where stars are being formed, identifying 2046 'clumps' (or locations where a lot of new stars are being born). Most of these regions aren't very old compared to the galaxy as a whole, which suggests that something has caused a sudden increase in the number of stars being formed in NGC 7793. They also note that the youngest clumps appear mostly in the spiral arms of the galaxy. The actual cause of the spiral pattern in galaxies is a debated topic, so this discovery has added another piece to the puzzle.
