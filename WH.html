                            The University of Birmingham's own observatory was established in 1982 as a
                            teaching laboratory for undergraduate students in physics and astronomy.
                            Today, students use the observatory as part of several laboratory courses in
                            the undergraduate degree programme.

                            <p> <p>Situated in Kings Norton, just 8 km away from the University campus, the
                            observatory is easily accessible. As a result, the University also hosts <i>
                                Astronomy in the City </i> several times throughout the year, where the
                            public (yes, <i> you </i>) can join us for stargazing, listen to talks from our
                            expert astronomers, and ask any question you ever wondered about astronomy.

                            <p><code> Objects in the infrared wavelengths will not be visible from here, why?</code>
                            <p>Though it would be possible to observe in radio
                            wavelengths, the observatory does not have a radio telescope on site.
                            There is a single telescope with a 50-cm diameter
                            mirror, and the primary instrument is an imaging camera that can take
                            pictures in broadband <i> optical </i> light, or using the B, V, R, I filters.

                            Unfortunately, the UK is not known to be have the best weather,
                            so you might have to wait for a couple of weeks to get your observation.
                            Despite the avert weather
                            conditions, small observatories such as this one make regularly contributions to astronomical
                            research. An example is the discovery of a bright Supernova in the nearby
                            galaxy M82 by students observing at the London Observatory in 2014.
