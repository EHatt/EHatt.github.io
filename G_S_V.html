                            <p><b>Well done, your research proposal was accepted!</b></p>
                            
                            <p>We can learn a lot about galaxies using visible light observatories, and choosing a location on the ground will save us a lot of money. We can't wait to hear about the science you are going to do!</p>
                            
                            <p>In fact, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898..142K">a recent discovery in June 2020</a> was made using the Subaru telescope in Hawaii that supports your proposal. Researchers trained a computer to pick out galaxies from visible light images of large patches of the sky. Using this method, they found lots of interesting new galaxies including HSC J1631+4426, which is 430 million light-years away! They were looking for galaxies that have a very small amount of oxygen compared to other elements. Oxygen is a good indicator of the age of a galaxy, since there are very few ways it can be produced. Almost all oxygen in galaxies is formed in the cores of very heavy stars. At the end of their lifetimes they explode, throwing all of the oxygen out into their surroundings. So by looking for galaxies with low oxygen, we are observing places where very few stars have reached the end of their lives. HSC J1631+4426 has the lowest fractional amount of oxygen ever found, so we likely could be looking at one of the most recently formed galaxies in the observable universe!</p>
