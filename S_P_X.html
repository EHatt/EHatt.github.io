                            <p><b>Well done, your research proposal was accepted!</b>
                            
                            <p>Like the name suggests X-ray pulsars display periodic pulses in X-ray frequencies. Choosing to study these from space was the correct option, as X-rays can't penetrate Earth's atmosphere. We cant wait to see what you will discover!
                            
                            <p>You may have been inspired by recent work with a pulsar called SAX J1808.4â€“3658. The pulsar is a part of a binary system, where two stars orbit a common center. Researchers discovered that this pulsar was sucking mass off its partner, which is a brown dwarf. At first, the material it pulls off orbits around the pulsar in a disk. However, once that disk gets to a certain size, the material starts to be captured by the pulsar. This causes a huge release of energy, causing an outburst of X-rays. The most recent outburst occured in 2019. The event happened a little later than researchers expected, which they believe could be due to a large amount of Helium.
