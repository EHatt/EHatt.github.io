                            <p><b>Well done, your research proposal was accepted!</b>
                            
                            <p>Jupiter is in our solar system, so you might think we've discovered all we can about it already. However, as with most of the objects in our solar system, there is still much to learn about its formation history and geology. Observing from the Earth was a wise choice, since we already have many observatories to choose from. We cant wait to see what you discover!
                            
                            <p> One of the most <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03382.pdf">recent discoveries</a> around Jupiter's moons was published in September 2020. After searching through a data set produced in 2010 by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, scientists found 52 objects which are likely to be moons. Prior to this, 15 moons were discovered in 2015 and a <a href="https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/sheppard/home/newjupitermoons2018">further 12 in 2018</a>. Jupiter certainly isn't a lonely planet!
