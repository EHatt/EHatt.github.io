                            <p><b>Well done, your research proposal was accepted!</b>
                            
                            <p>Jupiter is in our solar system, so you might think we've discovered all we can about it already. However, as with most of the objects in our solar system, there is still much to learn about its formation history and geology. Observing from the Earth was a wise choice, since we already have many observatories to choose from. We cant wait to see what you discover!
                            
                            <p> One of the most recent discoveries around Jupiter's moons was published in September 2020. After searching through a data set produced in 2010 by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope they found 52 objects that are most likely moons. Prior to this additional discoveries had been made of 15 moons in 2015, and 10 more in 2018! Jupiter certainly isn't a lonely planet.
