                            <p><b>Well done, your proposal was accepted</b>
                            
                            <p>We can learn a lot about galaxies using visible light observatories, and choosing a location in space will let us observe the dimmest ones that we cant see from the ground. We can't wait to hear about the science you are going to do!
                            
                            <p>You may have been inspired by recent work from January 2021 that used both the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observatories to study the spiral galaxy M51. Researchers were looking for evidence of supernovae, which occur when certain stars explode at the end of their lives. They discovered 179 supernova remnants (the stuff that gets left behind) and supernova candidates. Although the supernovas in this galaxy are fairly similar to those observed in other nearby spirals, the researches noted some peculiarities in their observations that might indicate subtle differences. They found these differences difficult to account for, which means there is more work to do!
